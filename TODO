What?
Currently the program matches the video looping speed by analysing the tempo of last 7 seconds of audio output. This works universally, but has 2 problems:
    - The program will adjust to tempo changes with some delay
    - It's impossible to make a certain moment of video loop to happen on a beat in music
These changes will fix the problems above when music is played on Spotify. Support for other music players should also be easy to add with just changing the dbus adapter a little

Milestone 1: Use DBus to detect when song changes on Spotify
[Mostly done]
- [DONE] Catch the DBus signal (PropertiesChanged) with a Qt Slot
    - The slot will be used to trigger audio analysis later
- [PARTIAL] Make sure that the signal means that the song has changed
    - And filter out if song is paused, forwarded, etc. and discard data
        - [DONE] Take timestamp of start and end times, check against spotify-given length
    [WONTFIX] - It's impossible to notice song when song ends if looping only 1 song in Spotify.
    [FIXME] - There is some timing delay when track changes in spotify. Spotify emits 6 signals when this happens.
            Using `dbus-monitor "type='signal',sender='org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.spotify'" --profile`
            it can be calculated that timing difference between the last of these 6 signals and the first when song changes
            deviates only ~0.1sec from spotify's reported song length. This should be explored if accurate beat hits are wanted.
            If accuracy is wanted, compare time inside the program to the one given by dbus-monitor.

Milestone 2: Create new audio data handler for whole song
[NOT STARTED]
- Do some (minor) modifications for the current class
- Create another instance of the class in audiodevice.cpp / h
    - [NOTE] how to handle song change?

Milestone 3: Calculate the beats for the whole song using rhythmextractor
[NOT STARTED]
- Differentiate somehow the short analysis and the whole song

Milestone 4: Create a database of beat timestamps when listening music on spotify
[NOT STARTED]
- Database has the following data:
    - Spotify trackid (unique)
    - Array of timestamps for beats
- A CSV file should work at first
    - [OPTIONAL]: use real database

Milestone 5: Adjust video loop speed according to database data
[NOT STARTED]
    - Record timestamp when the song changed
    - Detect if the song is found in the database
    - If song is in database, use the data to calculate video speed during the song
